	<h1> About Me </h1>
	<img id="TerynPic1" src="https://res.cloudinary.com/project-casting/image/upload/v1617858088/IMG_5893_kcvpig.jpg" Alt="Picture of Teryn Milliner">

    <p id="p1"> My name is Teryn Milliner. I was born in Detroit, MI on Mother's Day back in 1993. Every single year my maternal grandmother says I was the best Mother's Day gift ever, even to this day. She is also the person who gave me my name which she already loved, but also thought was fitting because my father's name is Terrence. I am so glad she named me because my mom was going to name me "Lamika Ja'Von" not that there's anything wrong if your name is Lamika Ja'Von. I just really like the name my grandmother chose. </p>

	<p id="p2">I graduated from Cass Technical Highschool. If you know anything about Detroit schools, you will know that Cass Tech is "#1, second to none". I was very shy in highschool but along with my major in Performing Arts, I've always loved the expression and STEM. My course load included AP Physics, AP Calcus and AP English among many others. Fast-forward to college at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, I stayed involved in both the Arts and Sciences. My interests included: </p>

	 <ul>
		<li>Theater (I was in German Theater for 2 years) </li>
		<li>German Language</li>
		<li>Volunteering (Helped start a Build On Chapter at U of M)</li>
		<li>Psychology</li>
		<li>Media</li>
	 </ul>

	 <p id="p3">*Fun Fact: I was also one of the first student hires at the University of Michigan Credit Union.</p>

	 <p id="p4"> After graduating from the University of Michigan with a BA in Psychology, I decided to leave my job at the Credit Union so that I could pursue a career in education and utilize my degree. I went on to become a licenced technician providing therapy for children on the Autism spectrum. I absolutely loved being able to see the students grow and become better with social interation, communication and behavioral skills. At the time, I also worked as a substitute teacher but I wanted to get more involved with making systemic change so I accepted an Americorps position with United Way as they worked to implement Work-Based Learning in many DPS schools.</p>

	 <p id="p5">This experience introduced me to power-apps and allowed me to realize just how much we needed  better organizational apps and tools to assist our teachers and students. Although my interest in coding began in a college introductory media course, this is when I realized how much I desired to be in the technology space. </p>

	 <h2 id="h2-1">I Have Skills...</h2>

	 <p id="6"> Ok, so we all have skills. I must admit, I'm better picking apart my flaws, but I am very skilled in quite a few things. Particularly the things that invole creative thinking, design and just having a heart to make people feel good about themselves. </p>

	 <ul id="list2">
		<li>Graphic arts (T-shirts, onesies, business cards, logos)</li>
		<li>Beautification of events and digital materials such as spreadsheets</li>
		<li>Helping people identify their needs</li>
		<li>Uplifting Others with words of encouragement</li>
	 </ul>

	 <h2 id="h2-2"> My Interests...</h2>
	 <p id="p7"> My interests span vast and wide. Including all of the things I've already mentioned. I also really enjoy baking, doing makeup, singing, dancing, writing, making music and gardening. I love a good adventure in new and known spaces. I love to travel and I love encouraging people. I even have a space online where I post motivational and encouraging material to help people keep their heads up above the clouds on those gloomy days. I plan to start a podcast series continuing to do the same thing and help shine this little light of mine. With all of my many interests, the goal is always to find myself in a career where I can be of service and make a difference in my communnity.</p>

	<h2 id="h2-3"> Career Goals</h2>
	<p id="p8">I want to be in a space where I can continuosly learn, grow and develop as a person and in my field. I hope to one day develop software that can help make lives easier and more efficient for people in education, the medical field and in everyday life. I would also like to highlight other people in the community who are helping make the world a better, more connected place by seamlessly bringing technology together with aspects of social justice, community, art and fashion. I have a lot to learn before I csn get there; and I am excited for the journey.</p>
